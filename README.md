# Build 47
Super simple command line utility to upload builds to App47.
 
Description
-----------
build_47 is a simple command line tool that allows you to easily post builds
(iOS .ipa's or Android .apk's) to [App47][app47] for distribution. 

Note, this utility only posts builds; nevertheless, the App47 API supports a slew
of other options, such as creating users, devices, groups, etc. Please see our [wiki][app47_wiki] 
for more details.

Internally, this Gem uses Ruby's nifty [REST Client][rest_client]. 

Installation
------------
    gem install build_47

Usage
------------

After you install the gem, you'll have a nifty command line utility dubbed `build_47` in your path. 

Minimal arguments required: 

	build_47 -t your_account_token -a app_id  -f path_to_build 

You can find your account token in your App47 account -- go to the **Profile** link and then click the **API** option to find it.

Optional arguments are

| Option  | Allowed values | Default Value | Description|
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| -e | Production, Test | Production | Environment for the build|

| -m | None | false | Make the build active after processing, if valid|
| -i | None | false | Reset the build identifier if it has changed|
